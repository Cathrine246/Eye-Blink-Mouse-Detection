# Eye-Blink-Mouse-Detection
This project uses computer vision and eye-tracking to control mouse actions through eye blinks instead of physical clicks. Built with Python, OpenCV, and Mediapipe, it detects the user's face and eyes in real time, counts blinks, and maps them to specific mouse events — such as single-click, double-click, or cursor control.
